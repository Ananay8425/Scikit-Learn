# Scikit-Learn Learning Hub  
**(by AS200585)**

A beginner-friendly collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources to help you master **scikit-learn** — the most accessible, powerful Python library for machine learning.

---

# Why This Repository Matters

- **Learn by doing** — Dive into concise, walk-through notebooks that take you from zero to scikit-learn essentials.  
- **Clear explanations, minimal jargon** — We emphasize *what you can achieve* rather than complex implementation details.  
- **Build real-world intuition** — Cover tasks like classification, regression, clustering, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AS200585/Scikit-Learn.git
````

2. **(Optional) create a virtual environment**
```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. **Run a sample notebook**

# Example: Train & Test a Classifier

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    data.data, data.target, random_state=42
)

# Train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
preds = clf.predict(X_test)
print(f"Test set accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, preds):.2f}")
```

# What You’ll Learn

* Fundamentals of **supervised learning**: classification, regression, evaluation
* **Data preparation**: train/test splits, feature scaling, pipelines
* **Model selection**: cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
* **Real-world workflow**: loading data, training models, evaluating results
